<h2>A suggestion for Bitstamp, bitcoin's biggest exchange</h2>
<p id="blog_date">April 4th, 2014</p>
<p id="blog_note">Note: This isn’t something you should panic over. It isn’t a sign that Bitstamp is insolvent or anything like that. They just messed up today and need to realize that and fix it because <a href="http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/volumepie/" target="_blank">they're the biggest bitcoin exchange in the world</a> and with great power comes great responsibility.</p>
<p>Enough Voltaire quotes. Today, I woke up to the following message from Bitstamp:</p>
<img id="bitstamp_message" src="/img/bitstamp.png" alt="bitstamp message" />
<p>I later found on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/228d7n/bitstamp_says_i_need_to_reverify_my_documents/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> that I wasn’t the only one who received this message today. So basically they found a few accounts that had documents that weren’t valid when they originally thought they were. This is totally acceptable to request valid documents based on this information, but their way of doing so is quite unacceptable.</p>
<p>They decided to respond to this information by “unverifying” my account. By doing so, they took away my ability to withdraw, deposit, and trade any funds. With something as volatile as bitcoin, this is very scary, especially considering a significant portion of my bitcoin holdings are with Bitstamp. Regardless of if the price of bitcoin crashes or goes to the moon tomorrow, I’m stuck holding bitcoins until I verify these forms. This process will likely take me over a week.</p>
<p>Now, I understand the associated risks of bitcoin and putting a ton of trust in Bitstamp, so no need to school me there. I’m a huge believer in bitcoin and I see companies like Mt. Gox going down to be positive for bitcoin because we’re filtering out the irresponsible companies that aren’t able to be responsible for the power that they have. I’m writing about this because yesterday I was a firm believer that Bitstamp is a company that is responsible for the power it has as the biggest bitcoin exchange, and I’d like to set them back on track.</p>
<p>Any company that holds their users’ money needs to set a very high standard for their customer service. They should act just like a bank or broker of USD or EUR would. If you want to not let me use your service initially until I verify some forms, great. But locking down any access whatsoever to all of my holdings *after* I've already used the service for four months is completely unacceptable. Either give me a few days notice or give me withdrawal privileges so that I can at least have access to my own damn money. Doing anything else is downright clowny and Goxy and, as the largest bitcoin exchange in the world, is a huge factor into what’s holding bitcoin back from being adopted as a real currency around the world.</p>
<p>So this is a message to Bitstamp and all other bitcoin companies/startups who hold bitcoins for their users. You are setting an example for everyone else, you are what is going to make or break bitcoin as a currency. Please don’t do clowny shit like this for the sake of bitcoin. Please give me access to my own damn money.</p>
